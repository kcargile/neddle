Neddle is an open source, mobile ready, SCORM compliant learning management system (LMS) built on the .NET platform using C#. Neddle was created to address the absence of a truly high-quality, commercial grade LMS in the OSS community. 

The project has several goals:
* Create a viable open source alternative to paid LMS solutions.
* Build a product that technologically advanced, yet simple in its use.
* Provide functionality and a user experience that is truly student and educator centric.
* Include SCORM conformance that is actually useful.
* Provide native support for popular mobile devices.
* Provide a rich set of course authoring tools and third-party tool integration options.
* Fit well with a wide variety of training paradigms, including corporate training, institutional teaching, and commercial services.
* Build vibrant on- and off-line communities around that platform.
* Keep installation, management, and use and use of the product by non-technical end users as simple as possible.
* Support OSS CLR implementations, e.g. Mono.
* Provide workable options for use in shared and cloud hosting environments.
* Provide workable options for use with emerging cloud technologies, for example cloud-based NOSQL data stores.
* Provide tight integration with various platform products and LOB systems; including content management systems, shopping cart applications, customer relationship management tools, and merchant gateway services.
